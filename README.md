# Athletic-Runner-Injury-Prediction-System
Competitive running, with its rigorous training regimens and intense competition, exposes athletes to a heightened risk of injuries that can profoundly impact performance and long-term careers. Prior ap- proaches to injury prediction in runners have often relied on simplistic models or lacked comprehen- sive data integration. Existing methods, while valuable, have limitations in terms of their accuracy and applicability. Many fail to consider the dynamic nature of injury risk across training cycles, individual variability, and environmental factors. Additionally, interpretability and athlete-specific recommenda- tions remain challenges. The proposed method combines diverse attributes including biomechanical data, training load metrics of the athlete to build a comprehensive injury prediction model. It employs various machine learning approaches to capture complex relationships within the data for early injury prediction. It establishes a feedback loop mechanism that enables athletes and coaches to act upon the modelâ€™s predictions, adjusting training plans and injury prediction as needed. Additionally, the system conducts a thorough comparison of various machine learning algorithms to identify and em- ploy the most accurate algorithm for the task at hand. This system aims to improve the well- being of competitive runners by reducing the risk of injuries, which is in line with Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.
