\textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
Competitive running, with its rigorous training regimens and intense competition, exposes
athletes to a heightened risk of injuries that can profoundly impact performance and long-term
careers. Prior approaches to injury prediction in runners have often relied on simplistic models
or lacked comprehensive data integration. Existing methods, while valuable, have limitations
in terms of their accuracy and applicability. Many fail to consider the dynamic nature of injury
risk across training cycles, individual variability, and environmental factors. Additionally,
interpretability and athlete-specific recommendations remain challenges. The proposed method
combines diverse attributes including biomechanical data, training load metrics of the athlete
to build a comprehensive injury prediction model. It employs various machine learning
approaches to capture complex relationships within the data for early injury prediction. It
establishes a feedback loop mechanism that enables athletes and coaches to act upon the
model's predictions, adjusting training plans and injury prediction as needed. Additionally, the
system conducts a thorough comparison of various machine learning algorithms to identify and
employ the most accurate algorithm for the task at hand. This system aims to improve the well-
being of competitive runners by reducing the risk of injuries, which is in line with Sustainable
Development Goals, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.

An activity diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that visually represents the flow of activities or actions within a system or process. It provides a structured way to illustrate the sequence of steps involved in completing a task, the decision points along the way, and the interactions between different components or actors within the system.\\

Activity diagrams are commonly used during the analysis and design phases of software development to model the behavior of a system or process. They help stakeholders and developers understand the flow of activities, identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and ensure that all necessary tasks are accounted for. Additionally, activity diagrams can be used to document existing processes, analyze and improve workflows, and communicate complex processes in a clear and visual manner.

\tab To address the class imbalance in the dataset, balanced the class distribution by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class (non-injury) to match the number of instances in the minority class (injury). By ensuring a more equitable representation of both classes in the training data, we aimed to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its ability to learn from the minority class instances. To further address the imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the minority class (injury) by adding an additional 575 instances, resulting in a balanced dataset comprising 1150 instances of both injury and non-injury classes. This augmentation ensured an equal representation of both classesin the training data, facilitating more robust model learning without the need for downsampling the majority class. To further improve class balance, we augmented the minority class (injury) by adding an additional 575 instances, resulting in a balanced dataset comprising 1725 instances of both injury and non-injury classes. This augmentation ensured a more equitable representation of both classes in the training data, mitigating potential biases and enhancing the model’s ability to learn meaningful patterns from both classes.\\

\tab  To achieve greater class balance, the minority class (injury) was augmented by incorporating an additional 575 instances. Consequently, the dataset now comprises 2300 instances, evenly distributed between injury and non-injury classes. This augmentation facilitated a more balanced representation of both classes during model training, reducing potential biases and enabling the model to discern meaningful patterns from both categories more effectively. The minority class (injury) underwent augmentation by adding an additional 575 instances. As a result, the dataset expanded to encompass 2875 instances, with an equal distribution between injury and non-injury classes. This augmentation facilitated a more balanced representation of both classes dur- ing model training, effectively mitigating potential biases and enhancing the model’s ability to discern meaningful patterns from both categories.\\


\tab A standardized procedure was followed for building the                model. The balanced dataset was divided into training and validation subsets, and the algorithm was trained on the training subset. The trained model’s performance was then evaluated on the validation set, calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 Score to assess its effectiveness in injury classification. Throughout this process, an iterative analysis of the model’s performance was conducted, adjusting parameters or employing feature engineering techniques as necessary to improve performance.\\

\tab By adhering to rigorous methodological practices, the pro- posed study aimed to establish a solid foundation for the investigation of injury prediction in athletic runners. This methodological framework laid the groundwork for the systematic exploration of algorithmic performance and its implications for injury classification, thereby facilitating the development of robust predictive models tailored to the unique challenges of athletic injury prevention.\\

\section{ \Large RESULTS \& DISCUSSION}
\end{center}
\tab
\text
With a clear understanding of the dataset, appropriate evaluation metrics were meticulously selected to comprehensively assess the performance of the predictive models. These evaluation metrics encompassed a diverse array, including the confusion matrix, ROC curve, accuracy, precision, and F1 Score. Each metric offered unique insights into the models’ predictive capabilities, allowing for a multifaceted examination of their performance. The confusion matrix, for instance, provided valuable insights into the models’ classification performance, delineating the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Concurrently, the ROC curve facilitated an assessment of the models’ ability to balance the true positive rate and false positive rate across various classification thresholds.\\

The validation curves, as illustrated in Figures 5.8 through 5.14, offer a comprehensive view of the performance dynamics of the mentioned algorithms. These curves showcase the behavior of both training and cross-validation scores as the complexity of the models varies. They provide a window into the algorithm's performance across a spectrum of complexities, revealing distinct patterns that are crucial for understanding the model's behavior.\\
\tab By examining these curves, one can discern how the performance of the algorithms changes with the adjustment of model complexity. Typically, as the complexity increases, the training score tends to improve, capturing more nuances and intricacies in the data. However, this improvement may not necessarily translate to better generalization performance, as indicated by the cross-validation score.\\
\tab The curves elucidate the delicate balance between bias and variance in the learning process. At lower levels of complexity, the model may exhibit high bias and low variance, resulting in underfitting. Conversely, at higher levels of complexity, the model may demonstrate low bias but high variance, indicative of overfitting. The validation curves help in identifying the sweet spot – the optimal level of complexity where the trade-off between bias and variance is minimized, leading to the best generalization performance.\\
\tab This analysis provides invaluable guidance for model selection and tuning, empowering practitioners to make informed decisions about the complexity of the model. By selecting the appropriate complexity level, one can mitigate the risk of underfitting or overfitting, ultimately enhancing the algorithm's predictive efficacy and ensuring its robust performance on unseen data.\\

The results in Table 5.1 (a) and (b), suggest that Bagging and Decision Tree may be promising algorithm for predicting athletic runner injuries, with potentially being more conservative in its predictions. However, further analysis and consideration of other factors, such as computational efficiency and interpretability, are warranted for comprehensive evaluation and selection of the most suitable algorithm.\\
\tab
The performance of the algorithms varied across different sizes in the dataset. Notably, models trained using Bagging and Decision Tree consistently shown the defined thresholds for accuracy and precision, indicating their robustness in predicting athletic runner injuries. These findings underscore the importance of dataset augmentation and the selection of appropriate algorithms in enhancing model performance for injury prediction tasks.\\
\tab
The analysis of the results reveals a notable trend where in machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrated comparatively better performance   than   deep   learning (DL) algorithms across various performance metrics. This observation can be attributed to the nature of the dataset, which predominantly comprises numerical features.\\
